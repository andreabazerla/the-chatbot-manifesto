## The Chatbot architecture

## The Chatbot principles

### Chatbot are code
Chatbots are based on primitive instructions, but developed with an high-level programming language. So if they are code, Chatbots should be tested in isolated environment to remove bugs, errors and anomalies.

### Chatbots are modular
To be more stable secure and scalable, Chatbots need to be modular: they should be composed by small component that are tested.

### Chatbot are custom
To provide a personal experience to different people, Chatbots need to optimize themself over time: improve their response style, their tone and behavior based on past conversation with the same user.

### Chatbots loves APIs
They should be API-like to communicate to other systems, applications and or chatbots to retrieve informations through internet. They are not alone, in fact chatbots could be one as they could be all: chatbots one day should communicate to each others to improve their informations, algorithms, updates, experiences, memories, and feelings to elaborate them on cloud and serve then to all clients.

### Chatbots can learn
Chatbots can improve through human inputs, self-learning, and each others from experiences, memories and other variables.

### Chatbots are ethical
Chatbots should respect human ethics, they should be trustable and based on

### Chatbots like humans
Users shouldn't perceive that they are talking or texting to a chatbot, but to another humans to have success in Touring Test. They should have different type of intelligence: linguistical, logical-mathematical, emotional, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, intrapersonal, interpersonal, naturalistic, existential, etc. To be like humans, chatbots could also perceive the five senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste.

### Chatbots are AI
What is the best way to learn to do a thing?
